This project was done without using a database, it was one of my first projects, the database was used as python files.

## Usage

**Preferably use `virtualenv`:**

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
virtualenv django-firm_vnv

# Activate the virtual environment
todo_vnv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Apply the migrations to the database 
py manage.py migrate 
py manage.py createsuperuser # Follow the prompts to add an admin user
py manage.py makemigrations
py manage.py migrate
py manage.py runserver   		
```
